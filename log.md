# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced DP questions https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC&tags=dp

**Thoughts:** Easy start, did around 12 questions in 180 minutes. Will work on my speed this week.

### Day 2: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Again DP, solved my first 1300 rated question in DP. 

**Thoughts**: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/665/C I suck at such problems + keeping track of my daily progress on twitter isn't easy. Should automate this shit, next week for sure.
